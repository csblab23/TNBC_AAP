# **Identification of TNBC-specific promoter switching events**

This repository contains scripts and data used to identify TNBC-specific Active Alternative Promoter (AAP) in the FUSCC cohort.

**Key Components**

1. *Find_TNBC_DEG_DRP.R*: Code to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) and differentially regulated promoters (DRP) in FUSCC.
2. *Panel2_figures.R*: Code to replicate all the figures presented in the Figure panel 02 of our paper.
3. *Code_for_Fig2f_HDAC9_trackplot.ipynb*: Code for making the HDAC9 trackplot presented in the figure panel 02.
