# **Analysis of Functional Regions of Transcripts**
This repository contains scripts and data used to study the differences in the functional regions: 5'UTR, Coding sequence (CDS), 3'UTR between the transcripts.

**Key Components**
1. *Extract_UTR_&_CDS_regions.R*: Code to extract the functional regions and prepare corresponding BED files for each of them.
2. *Figure_S2.R*: Code to replicate the figure presented in the supplementary figure S2b.
