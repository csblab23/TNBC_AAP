# **Identification of TNBC subtype-specific Active Alternative Promoters (AAPs)**

This repository contains scripts and data used to identify BL1-specific and Basal subtype-specific AAPs in the FUSCC cohort and their subsequent validation in the external dataset 1.

**Key Components**

1. *Proactiv_BL1_vs_REST.R*: Code to run proactiv pipeline on BL1 vs Rest of the TNBC samples in FUSCC and external dataset 1.
2. *PAM50_subtyping_external_dataset1.R*: Code to identify the Basal samples in external dataset 1 through the PAM50 subtyping.
3. *Proactiv_BASAL_vs_NON_BASAL.R*: Code to run proactiv pipeline on Basal vs the Non-Basal samples in FUSCC and external dataset 1.
4. *Find_BL1_specific_AAPs_and_validation.R*: Code to identify BL1-specific DEGs and DRPs in FUSCC cohort and their validation in the external dataset 1.
5. *Find_BASAL_specific_AAPs_and_validation.R*: Code to identify Basal subtype-specific DEGs and DRPs in FUSCC cohort and their validation in the external dataset 1.
6. *Panel3_figures.R*: Code to replicate all the figures presented in the Figure panel 03 of our paper.
