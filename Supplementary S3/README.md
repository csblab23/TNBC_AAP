This repository contains scripts and data used to evaluate the distribution of the 5000 iteration cutoff values and the validate the obtained prognostic AAPs in external dataset 3.

**Key Components**

1. *script_01_Maxstat_cutoff_boxplots.R*: Code to generate figure S3a,b.
2. *script_02_KM_plot_S3c.R*: Code to generate figure S3c.
3. *script_03_external_val_only_TNBC_samples.R*: Code to generate figure S3d-g. This validation was done only on the TNBC patients of external dataset 3.
4. *script_03_external_val_all_BC_samples.R*: Code to generate figure S3h-k. This validation was done on all breast cancer patients of external dataset 3.
