# Uncovering the Role of Active Alternative Promoters (AAP) in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Patients 

This repository contains the codes and relevant data files used to generate the results in our paper titled '*Alternative Promoters Drive Transcriptomic Reprogramming and Prognostic Stratification in TNBC*'. 

## Basic Overview of contents
1. *Figure 1/* – Code and data for reproducing the results in Figure panel 1 related to the basic landscape of active promoters identified in FUSCC cohort.
2. *Figure 2/* – Code and data for reproducing the results in Figure panel 2 related to TNBC-specific promoter switching event observed in HDAC9 minor promoters.
3. *Figure 3/* – Code and data for reproducing the results in Figure panel 3 related to identification of TNBC subtype-specific active alternative promoters (AAPs).
4. *Figure 4/* – Code and data for reproducing the results in Figure panel 4 related to identification of prognostically significant AAPs.
5. *Figure 5/* – Code and data for reproducing the results in Figure panel 5 related to the construction of multiple risk assessment models using different feature sets.

Each directory contains a dedicated README file that provides information about the scripts and data files included within it.
